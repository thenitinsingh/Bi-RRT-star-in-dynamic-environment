A study on rapidly exploring random trees with dynamic obstacles

In the field of robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation, pathfinding is an important aspect especially when operating in an environment with dynamic obstacles. This study focuses on the application and enhancement of the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm, specifically the Bi-RRT* variant, to effectively navigate through spaces where obstacles may change positions over the time.
RRT is a famous probabilistic path planning algorithm known for efficiency in exploration with large, high-dimensional spaces. The algorithm involves incrementally building a tree starting from a given initial configuration by random sampling of the search space and extending the tree toward these samples. The extension of Bi-RRT* involves growing two trees simultaneously: one from the start and another from the goal. It then attempts to connect the trees, which increases the likelihood of finding the optimal path.
Challenge in real-world pathfinding is dealing with dynamic obstacles-obstacles whose position changes over time. Traditional RRT algorithms assume a static environment (i.e., the obstacles are fixed at a certain position) which makes them less effective in scenarios where the position of the obstacle is uncertain or the obstacles are moving.This study addresses this challenge by incorporating a mechanism for dynamically updating the positions of obstacles within the search space, ensuring that the pathfinding algorithm adapts to these changes.
➔	Obstacles are represented as geometric shapes, such as circles or polygons. These obstacles can shift their positions during the execution of the algorithm, simulating a dynamic environment.
➔	The Bi-RRT* algorithm is implemented with added functionality to handle dynamic obstacles. This involves continuously monitoring the positions of obstacles and recalculating the path whenever an obstacle moves.
➔	After a feasible path is found, a suitable path smoothing algorithm is applied to smooth the path, ensuring it is not only collision-free but also suitable for navigation by robots or autonomous vehicles.
➔	The pathfinding process and the dynamic movement of obstacles are visualized using Matplotlib. As obstacles move, the algorithm recalculates and updates the path in real-time, which is displayed dynamically.
Thus, this extended version of the Bi-RRT* algorithm, which is capable of changing obstacles dynamically, can efficiently adapt to changes in the environment and return a collision-free path.  Real-time visualization and path smoothing techniques integrated into the algorithm further strengthen its applicability in practical use. Future work may aim at the efficient running of the algorithm in extreme dynamic scenarios or merging more complex behaviors within obstacles.
